I am a Ph.D. student at [Intelligent Driving Lab (iDLab)](http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/), Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Shengbo Eben Li](http://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/80/1812.html) and [Bo Cheng](http://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/80/1799.html). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor degree from Tsinghua University in 2021.

My research covers reinforcement learning, autonomous driving, and optimal control.
